Sayonara, my Mayor!
The inhabitants of Valadilène elect a mayor every 50 years.

A mayor has very important
duties such as deciding the decorations of Valadilène during the festivities or organizing the
Maxi-Delirium, the monthly buffet where Valadilène citizens meet and have fun. However, a
mayor has also to resolve the conflicts between rival families, especially those who started a
war hundred years ago, and they do not remember why anymore. Many other tasks keep
the mayor busy, time goes by and, after 50 years, the citizens need to decide whether to
confirm the mayor, or kick them out from Valadilène for the bad job! “Sayonara, my Mayor!”
is the typical phrase the folks tell to an unconfirmed mayor while they leave Valadilène.

It is curious how the Valadilène system to elect and confirm was born. It began as a game
3500 years ago, when Valadilène was ruled by annoying people who claimed to be sons of a
few Gods and called themselves Pharaohs, or something. Everyone liked the game and
stopped considering the Pharaohs, despite their complaints. Nowadays, Pharaohs have a
cozy cat café in the city center. They always loved cats.


Basically, anyone can be a mayor. The career begins with the candidate working as a
mayor-in-trial for a month. The main challenge of a mayor-in-trial is to organize the
Maxi-Delirium. At the end of the month the citizens are called to confirm, or not, the
mayor-in-trial. If confirmed, the mayor-in-trial becomes mayor for the next 50 years, and the
citizens are called again to vote for the confirmation at the end of these 50 years.
Confirming a mayor is a period of creativity at Valadilène. Each citizen creates in secret their
own sigil, a symbol that they will use to associate a vote to themselves in the future. It is
tradition, after the mayor confirmation, to call a competition for the best looking sigil, but
this is another story. Each citizen puts inside an envelope their sigil, a voting doblon, and a
portion of their soul. The doblon has two sides: a yay side, which illustrates a long hat, and a
nay side, which illustrates a boot in the act of kicking. Anyone can color only one side that
represents their vote in favor, yay, or not in favor, nay, to the mayor. The soul represents
what someone calls “money”, and during the voting it represents appreciation, or
depreciation, to the mayor: the more soul a citizen invests, the more their vote counts.
When the voting period is over Fibonacci, Ada, and Nakamoto, the counting council
members, count the votes. They sum the soul attached to the yay doblons and to the nay
doblons. If there is more yay soul, the mayor in charge is confirmed for fifty years! If there is
more nay soul, the mayor in charge is kicked out from Valadilène and “Sayonara, my
Mayor!”. 

What is the purpose of the sigil, you ask? Well, the voters who “lost” can get back
their soul if they prove to have a sigil identical to the one that was put inside the envelope.
That’s why the sigil competition is called only after the confirmation of the mayor, because
the sigils have to remain secret, otherwise someone can claim the soul of other citizens!
I hope that your curiosity about Valadilène is now satisfied. Probably many things sound
weird to you, a living creature, but you will understand one day, in the future…


A Solidity smart contract implements the Valadilène mayor confirmation system.
The constructor of the smart contract accepts three parameters: the mayor address, an
escrow address, and the quorum i.e. the number of envelopes to send, and to open, to
terminate the mayor confirmation. The smart contract collects the envelopes, opens them,
and computes the outcome.
The main functions are the following:
- compute_envelope(): An envelope is computed hashing the byte representation of three
inputs: the sigil (uint), the doblon (bool), the soul (uint). The byte representation of an
arbitrary input can be obtained with Solidity’s abi.encode(params, ...), which returns bytes,
and the hash is computed with Solidity keccak256, which returns bytes32.
- cast_envelope(): The smart contract collects envelopes until it reaches the quorum.
- open_envelope(): After that, each voter can open any envelope they previously casted to
officially express their vote. A voter provides the inputs previously used to compute the
envelope: the sigil, the doblon, and the soul. In this phase the soul is actually sent to the
smart contract as cryptocurrency.
- mayor_or_sayonara(): After all envelopes have been opened, the smart contract checks
whether the mayor is confirmed or not: the mayor gets confirmed if the yay votes are
strictly greater (>) than the nay votes. In any case, the voters who expressed the “losing
vote” (nay in case of confirmation, yay in case of rejection) get their soul back as refund. If
the mayor has been confirmed, the new mayor receives, to their address, the soul
associated with the yay votes as a contribution to the expenses for the next 50 years;
otherwise, the soul associated with the nay votes is assigned to the “escrow account” that
was declared during the creation of the contract.
